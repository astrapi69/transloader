	 * <p>
	 * However, the fact that it only clones what is necessary to make the object graph compatible

	 * <code>ClassLoader</code>, it is possible that a top level object is not cloned but objects it
	 * references through fields are cloned. This effectively means that the existing object graph
	 * can be altered rather than a new, purely seperate object graph being created. This <b>may not
	 * be what you want</b> if you want to continue using the given object in its original context.
	 * In which case, use {@link #MAXIMAL}.
